For those who just started learning Bioinformatics sometimes wonder, "what kind of things do bioinformatician really do? Isit as simple as counting DNA or gc_content? Shouldn't be rite?"

In this repository, I am compiling all contracts/jobs I received on Upwork as Bioinformatician. Giving an insight on some jobs Bioinformatician do.

Each directory contains:
1. Job_description.txt
        a. how much does this job pay
        b. time limit for the job
        c. took how long to write the script
        d. how long it took to close the project (receive payment)
        
2. Conversation_summary.txt
Most of the time what the clients want is hard to describe and deviate from Job_description. This file contain additional information about the task/job. I also write my approach to finish the task and obstacle that i think worth mentioning.
