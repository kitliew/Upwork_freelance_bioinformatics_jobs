Work Description
Dear all,

I am looking for a short-term collaboration with a bioinformatician who could help me to create a script that would do the following:

1. for a given gene/protein â€“ retrieve its homologs in bacterial species (based on annotated name or sequence homology) from any major database of nucleotide sequences and add these nucleotide sequences next to a corresponding organism in the input .csv file
2. for each of the retrieved sequences, calculate their GC content and write this information next to the corresponding sequence in the .csv file.

Ideally, the script should work in python 3 and run like this:
python script_GC_calculator.py $protein_id $input.csv > $output.csv

Attached is an example of the input.csv file.

Please feel free to ask me any questions and negotiate. Will be glad to talk out all the details before the commitment.

Best regards,
XXX
